<h2><b>How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?</b></h2>

I interpret user needs and implement them into a program by creating a sentence with who wants the program to do something, what they want the program to do, and why they want the program to do that. This allows me to create user stories which define a set of requirements that can be used to test the program.

<h2><b>How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?</b></h2>

I approach developing programs by just diving into what I feel the program needs to do. As I am developing features, anything that I realize needs to get done first, I will switch over to that. The agile process I hope to incorporate into my future development work is the listing of all the tasks for the program before beginning development. This will help me organize the tasks allowing for an easier flow in developing the program. 

<h2><b>What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?</b></h2>

Being a good team member in software development means the ability to convey what you can do and any issues you come across. This allows the other members of the team to know who they can ask for help and know how they can assist you with your issues. Being a good team member also means taking constructive criticism well. This is important because learning from your failures is a great way to learn.
